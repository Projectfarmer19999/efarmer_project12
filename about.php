                    A farmer[1] (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a laborer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past, a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).

                    <h3>Our Goals</h3>                    
                    <p>Build a web portal for farmers to provide the freedom of buying and selling of crops to them directly without any intervention. It will provide them with different features like weather forecasting. It will help farmers in getting a better price for their crops.</p>
